./DUMMY3/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0294.flac|8|It was, in short, the platform of the pillory;

./DUMMY3/audio/11697_other/13673/actressinhighlife_03_bowen_0134.flac|1|Very true.
./DUMMY3/audio/6097_clean/14411/nada_lily_08_haggard_0328.flac|3|I saw her come, I felt the blow on my face as a man feels in a dream.
./DUMMY3/audio/9017_clean/13130/dartagnan01_33_dumas_0298.flac|5|He might fail, but something must be left to chance.
./DUMMY3/audio/6097_clean/9575/astralplane_04_leadbeater_0369.flac|3|The same is of course true of those who live in water, air or ether.

./DUMMY3/audio/11697_other/15543/aliceofoldvincennes_06_thompson_0085.flac|1|That was truly a great feat; but the hero never explained.
./DUMMY3/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0855.flac|8|Finally,
./DUMMY3/audio/9017_clean/13885/dartagnan03part1_036_dumas_0084.flac|5|yes;
./DUMMY3/audio/12787_other/13887/dayoffate_20_roe_0249.flac|9|Am I not the most singularly fortunate man that ever existed?
./DUMMY3/audio/8051_other/9685/annualreportseducation_02_mann_0138.flac|6|What can be done to reclaim them?
./DUMMY3/audio/9136_other/11325/vanityfair_29_thackeray_0214.flac|0|But I needn't ask: how pretty she looks!
./DUMMY3/audio/9017_clean/14261/dartagnan03part3_49_dumas_0091.flac|5|"Well?"

./DUMMY3/audio/11614_other/12220/barontrump_30_lockwood_0028.flac|2|What was to be done?
./DUMMY3/audio/8051_other/9685/annualreportseducation_11_mann_0749.flac|6|I will take a few examples from a reading-book now in use in some of our schools.
./DUMMY3/audio/11614_other/12220/barontrump_31_lockwood_0085.flac|2|I forgot them the day my own name slipped from my mind!
./DUMMY3/audio/9136_other/10673/secondsight_09_leverson_0054.flac|0|But it's absurd to tell Lady Conroy that back!

./DUMMY3/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0344.flac|8|Anyhow,
./DUMMY3/audio/9136_other/10673/secondsight_19_leverson_0021.flac|0|If it was true, did it matter?

./DUMMY3/audio/12787_other/13887/dayoffate_29_roe_0133.flac|9|Can it be that she was sorrowful in the meeting-house for my sake only?

./DUMMY3/audio/6670_other/8541/atlanticnarratives2_06_thomas_0106.flac|4|Did she think he was a foreigner?
./DUMMY3/audio/9017_clean/14261/dartagnan03part3_90_dumas_0223.flac|5|said he,

./DUMMY3/audio/6671_other/5479/monsieurlecoq_2_12_gaboriau_0002.flac|7|What grace and what dignity!
./DUMMY3/audio/8051_other/9685/annualreportseducation_16_mann_0137.flac|6|These are personal, not hereditary;

./DUMMY3/audio/12787_other/14079/herotales_25_burnham_0229.flac|9|There was no North, no East, no West - only South.
./DUMMY3/audio/11614_other/12352/prideofjennico_08_castle_0005.flac|2|I had meant to be master: I found myself a slave!

./DUMMY3/audio/6671_other/12092/silentbattle_05_gibbs_0380.flac|7|Won't you sit down again?
./DUMMY3/audio/6670_other/8541/atlanticnarratives2_11_thomas_0132.flac|4|Who'd ever think to see you now, that you ever had any such ideas?
./DUMMY3/audio/12787_other/13404/openingachestnutburr_12_roe_0014.flac|9|She did not answer him.
./DUMMY3/audio/12787_other/13887/dayoffate_03_roe_0118.flac|9|When would the perverse world begin to assert itself?
./DUMMY3/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0395.flac|8|Enough, however - the world grew older, and the dream vanished.
./DUMMY3/audio/6097_clean/14843/bambatse_21_haggard_0013.flac|3|Who can say?
./DUMMY3/audio/9136_other/10673/secondsight_24_leverson_0109.flac|0|that sort of thing.
./DUMMY3/audio/12787_other/13887/dayoffate_10_roe_0097.flac|9|In one respect I think it's better - there are no snakes here.
./DUMMY3/audio/11614_other/12352/prideofjennico_09_castle_0436.flac|2|What need is there for me to write down what I endured that black night?
./DUMMY3/audio/6670_other/12576/goldengemsoflife_066_allen_0195.flac|4|Her companionship, her joy, she finds in these sentiments.
./DUMMY3/audio/11697_other/15678/thirdvolume_07_hume_0094.flac|1|What is your reason?
./DUMMY3/audio/11614_other/11965/petersimple_29_marryat_0244.flac|2|At last he was put in his cot, and never rose from it again.
./DUMMY3/audio/6671_other/5479/monsieurlecoq_2_12_gaboriau_0025.flac|7|Yes, she shall be mine; I will have her!

./DUMMY3/audio/6097_clean/13657/roots_48_morris_0111.flac|3|And the gift of the aid Of the unafraid!
./DUMMY3/audio/6671_other/12092/silentbattle_18_gibbs_0276.flac|7|I had a lot of nerve to do a thing like that, Phil, but you see -

./DUMMY3/audio/6097_clean/15326/hartmann_06_fawcett_0066.flac|3|But where's your coat, man?

./DUMMY3/audio/6097_clean/13418/shortstories_10_gaskell_0721.flac|3|And the more frightened she grew, the worse she got on.
./DUMMY3/audio/11697_other/14407/bessiesfortune_23_holmes_0279.flac|1|There is nothing for me to do; absolutely nothing.
./DUMMY3/audio/12787_other/13887/dayoffate_04_roe_0293.flac|9|Indeed, I like to have half a dozen gentlemen around me.
./DUMMY3/audio/12787_other/14124/search_11_hill_0204.flac|9|How they made his blood boil even now!
./DUMMY3/audio/9136_other/11325/vanityfair_02_thackeray_0268.flac|0|because of her hundred thousand pounds!
./DUMMY3/audio/6097_clean/15326/hartmann_06_fawcett_0072.flac|3|Have you cooks or servants?
./DUMMY3/audio/6097_clean/13657/roots_07_morris_0261.flac|3|Have patience!
./DUMMY3/audio/11697_other/14407/bessiesfortune_08_holmes_0071.flac|1|Was his grandfather happy now?

./DUMMY3/audio/9136_other/10673/secondsight_12_leverson_0163.flac|0|And yet you'd think he'd know a bit about it, too!
./DUMMY3/audio/6097_clean/15326/hartmann_02_fawcett_0401.flac|3|Yes, I'm your man; but we must have no companions-for obvious reasons.
