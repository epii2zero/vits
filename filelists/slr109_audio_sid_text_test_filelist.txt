./DUMMY3/audio/6097_clean/14764/jaufry_07_lafon_0007.flac|3|exclaimed aloud:

./DUMMY3/audio/12787_other/13887/dayoffate_12_roe_0029.flac|9|Reuben sat down on the piazza, in his quiet, undemonstrative way.
./DUMMY3/audio/9017_clean/11216/celebratedcrimesv1_16_dumas_0020.flac|5|The nomination came to pass:

./DUMMY3/audio/12787_other/13871/bigbluesoldier_04_hill_0005.flac|9|But the door was not shut.
./DUMMY3/audio/11697_other/15885/strangeworld_11_braddon_0142.flac|1|He had a little craft of his own, four or five tons burden, and was passionately fond of the water.
./DUMMY3/audio/11614_other/12220/barontrump_24_lockwood_0118.flac|2|Then, as she plucked me by the sleeve, I pleaded,

./DUMMY3/audio/9136_other/10673/secondsight_08_leverson_0021.flac|0|But for anything else!
./DUMMY3/audio/12787_other/13887/dayoffate_32_roe_0179.flac|9|more bitterly;

./DUMMY3/audio/12787_other/13887/dayoffate_10_roe_0135.flac|9|Well, prove that I don't.

./DUMMY3/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0252.flac|8|indeed, he sets himself to reflect on his suffering, but in vain!

./DUMMY3/audio/6671_other/13462/yellowdove_10_gibbs_0257.flac|7|fascinated,

./DUMMY3/audio/6671_other/12092/silentbattle_05_gibbs_0382.flac|7|Slowly he obeyed, dumb with fatigue, but inexpressibly grateful.
./DUMMY3/audio/6670_other/6416/fourweirdtales_08_blackwood_0263.flac|4|a numbing, aching pain possessed him.
./DUMMY3/audio/8051_other/8930/trialofsusanbanthony_17_anonymous_0326.flac|6|Ridiculously absurd question, you say.
./DUMMY3/audio/9017_clean/13130/dartagnan01_33_dumas_0198.flac|5|He resumed his listening, but unfortunately the toilet was finished.

./DUMMY3/audio/6670_other/6416/fourweirdtales_07_blackwood_0293.flac|4|He sighed.
./DUMMY3/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0397.flac|8|How am I to express myself?
./DUMMY3/audio/11697_other/15543/aliceofoldvincennes_16_thompson_0273.flac|1|He gazed for some time, not without a sense of villainy, while she continued her sweetly monotonous reading.

./DUMMY3/audio/11614_other/11965/petersimple_16_marryat_0271.flac|2|He then asked what I was - what sort of officer - was I captain?

./DUMMY3/audio/6097_clean/13418/shortstories_10_gaskell_0764.flac|3|crying out,

./DUMMY3/audio/11614_other/12220/barontrump_22_lockwood_0140.flac|2|And yet I was still outside the throne-room of his frigid Majesty!

./DUMMY3/audio/12787_other/13887/dayoffate_01_roe_0119.flac|9|The air was close, the sky leaden; even the birds would not sing.
